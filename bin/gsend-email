  Wrapper around git send-email, that sends through gmail and creates
  a private temporary directory holding a file with the user and
  password, so as to well keep it private.

  NOTE: uses the user from the smtp config as from address, together
  with the gcos user fullname. (git send-email seems to put the author
  as a From line into the email body if it's different from the from
  address of the email, so no risk it seems.)
