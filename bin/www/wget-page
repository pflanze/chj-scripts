#        -N
#               --timestamping
# 	                 Turn on time-stamping.

#        -E
#        --html-extension
#            If a file of type application/xhtml+xml or text/html is downloaded and the URL does
#            not end with the regexp \.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?, this option will cause the suffix .html
#            to be appended to the local filename.  This is useful, for instance, when you're mir-
#            roring a remote site that uses .asp pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be view-
#            able on your stock Apache server.  Another good use for this is when you're download-
#            ing CGI-generated materials.  A URL like http://site.com/article.cgi?25 will be saved
#            as article.cgi?25.html.

# #ach shit.
#  und ja url mangling und so  und mein comment vornedran  fehlt ja eh noch  thus eh mal noch selber machen ?.
#        -H
#        --span-hosts
#            Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.

#        -k
#        --convert-links
#            After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to make them suit-
#            able for local viewing.  This affects not only the visible hyperlinks, but any part of
#            the document that links to external content, such as embedded images, links to style
#            sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.
# ...
#        -K
#        --backup-converted
#            When converting a file, back up the original version with a .orig suffix.  Affects the
#            behavior of -N.
