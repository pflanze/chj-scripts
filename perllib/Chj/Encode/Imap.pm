=head1 NAME

Chj::Encode::Imap

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Modified utf-7 encoding as used by IMAP servers like (courier and) dovecot.

=head1 NOTES

The dot "." is not converted, neither is "/".

Thunderbird, when entering a subfolder name with a dot, leads to the
actual creation of nested folders. When entering a subfolder with "/"
in the name, that is converted to a "." and then behaves the
same. When entering a subfolder with multiple dots (and/or slashes),
it is silently ignored.

So be sure to convert slashes (and dots) yourself before using the
result in filesystem paths!

Additionally, the Thunderbird/Dovecot combination swallow everything
after and including any ">" char! So be sure to change > to something
else or so.
