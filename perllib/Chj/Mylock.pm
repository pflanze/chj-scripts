=head1 NAME

Chj::Mylock

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# when needing a private lock:
#my $l= new_mylock;
# Whereas when needing a shared lock, shared by path:
#my $l= $the_shared_path;

{
    xmylock $l; # waits indefinitely to get the lock

    # Stop and throw an exception after 10 seconds of waiting; will not
    # release the lock:
    #xmylock $l, 10;

    # After 10 seconds of waiting, claim the lock; don't use if there is a
    # possibility for suspended processes, or if the program can't cope with
    # half-done work by an interrupted program!
    #my $was_claimed= xmylock $l, 10, 1;
    # xmylock returns undef when getting the lock immediately, 0 when
    # getting the lock after some waiting, and an array reference of
    # lock paths when claimed after a timeout.
    # A warning is printed when claiming the lock, to disable:
    # local $Chj::Mylock::warn_claims= 0;  

    # do stuff

    xmyunlock $l;
    # If you used the version of xmylock that can claim a lock, you
    # *must* pass its return value to xmyunlock:
    #xmyunlock $l, $was_claimed;
}


# If you can afford automatic unlocking on exceptions (no risk of
# leaving behind corrupted state):

with_mylock {
    # do stuff;
    # $Chj::Mylock::was_claimed represents the return value of
    # xmylock, i.e. whether the lock was claimed.
} $l, $timeout, $do_claim_after_timeout;


# When not needing $l anymore (unlinks the file at $l):
#mylock_free $l


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Someone had told me in the early 2000's that flock wasn't
reliable. Then in 2013(?) I had a reproducible case where flock wasn't
reliable (on Linux). So I gave up and in and went with lock files (like
everybody else?). Hey, at least it only links a pre-existing file,
somewhat less overhead?
